# IC-Detec-oFacialComPython

Hello, this algorithm was created in order to study the analytical performance of the main facial detection algorithms, a mixed dataset containing 400 animal images and 600 human face images was used, with this I was able to verify the accuracy of the algorithms and their processing performance of images.

to install you will need

1 - latest version of python, version 3.10.4 was used for this algorithm

2 - create a virtual environment with the following commands

2.1 - python -m venv venv inside the folder where these files are downloaded

2.2 - cd venv to enter the folder that will be created by python inside the file

2.3 - type .\Scripts\activate inside the venv folder to activate the virtual environment, note that on the left side it will be written venv in green, if so the virtual environment is activated.

2.4 - cd .. to exit the venv directory and return to the project directory

3 - install the libraries that are underlined using pip from python

4 - the dlib library can present problems in the installation, for this in this link you have to download a file to download and install it, you need to download it and within the IDE terminal access the files in this folder, in my case I saved the folder on the desktop and from the terminal I cd until I entered the directory where the file is and then I gave the command pip install <FileName> and so it did the installation successfully, it is necessary to restart the IDE to recognize the library.
